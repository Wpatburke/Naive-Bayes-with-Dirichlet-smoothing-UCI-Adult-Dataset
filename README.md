# Naive-Bayes-with-Dirichlet-smoothing-UCI-Adult-Dataset

This code uses a modified version of the Adult Dataset the data is provided as three separate files:
a7a.train : used to train the model
a7a.dev : used to find the optimal lambda
a7a.test : used to test the accuracy of our model

Accuracy from Naive Bayes Classifier with Dirichlet Smoothing:
The train set gave an accuracy of:
13385 correct predictions for 16100 points.
The accuracy is 0.831366459627

The dev set gave an accuracy of:
6708 correct predictions for 8000 points.
The accuracy is 0.8385

The test set gave an accuracy of:
7064 correct predictions for 8461 points.
The accuracy is 0.834889492968
